SLICOT Library Subdirectory benchmark_data
------------------------------------------

SLICOT Library Subdirectory benchmark_data contains data files (*.dat) for the
SLICOT Library benchmark collections.  These files are used by the Chapter B
SLICOT routines, but they could also be used independently for testing some
algorithms on difficult numerical problems.  Special standard or generalized
continuous-time or discrete-time systems are generated, as well as examples
of Riccati or (generalized) Lyapunov equations.  To be used in a specific
program, via calls to the Chapter B routines, the required data files should
be available in the directory where the executable program has been launched
from.
