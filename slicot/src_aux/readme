SLICOT Library Subdirectory src_aux
-----------------------------------

SLICOT Library Subdirectory src_aux contains few auxiliary LAPACK and
BLAS source files which either slightly differ from the standard
distribution, or are explicitly needed for generating the SLICOT-based
MATLAB executable files (MEX-files) for a specific platform.

The currently included files are dcabs1 and dlagv2.
Other files might be included, as specified in the Release.Notes
or Release.History files.

The file dcabs1 is a copy of the BLAS routine which might be missing
in some distributions.  To generate the object code for dcabs1, the
file makefile in the subdirectory src_aux should be modified accordingly
(see the included comments).

A variable used but not always initialized in the file dlagv2 has been set.

More details are given in the file Installation.txt from the SLICOT
root directory.
