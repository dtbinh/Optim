SLICOT Library Subdirectory examples77
--------------------------------------

SLICOT Library Subdirectory examples77 contains all source files for
the Fortran 77 example programs calling the SLICOT Library routines,
the associated data files (files *.dat), and reference results
(files *.res).  The Fortran files differ from those in the subdirectory
examples in having references to the INTRINSIC functions MAX and MIN
in PARAMETER statements avoided, as they are not allowed in Fortran 77.
The reference results have been computed on a Sun Ultra 2 machine, for
the Unix distribution, and on an Intel Pentium 3 machine, for the
Windows distribution.

If executable Fortran 77 example programs are created when installing
the SLICOT software (as described in the Installation.txt file from the
SLICOT root directory), these programs are executed and their results
are stored in the files *.exa (with the same name as for the files with
data and reference results, and extension exa).  More details for
executing other tasks, e.g., cleaning the subdirectory examples77,
are given in the file makefile included in this subdirectory.
